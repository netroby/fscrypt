## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License

this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

## Before you submit a pull request

If you are making changes to the `fscrypt` component, you will need to have
[govendor](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor) installed, and you will want
to use the following additional commands:
*   `make update` - Updates the dependencies in the `vendor/` directory.
*   `make go` - Generates, builds, and tests all the Go code. Requires
    [protoc (v3.0 or later)](https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases) and
    [protoc-gen-go](https://github.com/golang/protobuf).
*   `make format` - Formats all of the go code.
*   `make lint` - Checks the code for style errors. Requires
    [`golint`](https://github.com/golang/lint).
*   `make all` - Runs the above commands, builds `fscrypt` and `pam_fscrypt.so`.

These commands should be run before submitting a pull request.

Make sure that `$GOPATH/bin` is in you `$PATH`. All the above dependencies can
be installed with:
``` bash
# Grab the latest version of protoc from github.com/google/protobuf/releases
> curl -L <download_link_for_your_architecture> > protoc.zip
> unzip protoc.zip -d protoc
> sudo mv protoc/bin/protoc /usr/local/bin/
> rm -rf protoc.zip protoc/
# Grab the go packages in the standard manner
> go get -u github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go
> go get -u github.com/kardianos/govendor
> go get -u github.com/golang/lint/golint
```
